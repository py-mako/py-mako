- 👀 I’m interested in fun and interesting Data Engineering and Data Science projects. Also open to any ML, DL, NN project in Python and spatial :earth_africa:	and satellite data :artificial_satellite: usage. Recently I am more focused on Data Engineering topics and technologies.

- 🌱 Started learning Java programming language and am interested in all Data Engineering tools.

-  I have finished Data Science bootcamp at [Brainster Data Science Bootcamp](https://brainster.io/vienna) and [Applied Data Science I: Scientific Computing & Python](https://www.credly.com/org/wqu/badge/applied-data-science-i-scientific-computing-python-with-honors) at WorldQuant University.
  * SQL databases
  * APIs
  * Python
  * Maths and Stats 
  * Machine Learning
  * Deep Learning
  * Neural Networks      
  * webb app development (Flask, Django)
  * and always something more :)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects, preferably involving GIS and spatial/satellite data (experience with Sentinel and Landsat satellite constellations)

- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bojan-k-76403565/) or via email if there is an interesting problem or project. 
      Always open to anything related to SQL, Python, satellite imagery classification and spatial data and databases.
